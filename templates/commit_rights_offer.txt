Subject: Matplotlib commit rights

<name>,


We would like to invite you to join the Matplotlib organization on github with
commit rights to the main Matplotlib repository! (you should have the GH emails
in your inbox).

Please see https://matplotlib.org/devel/coding_guide.html#detailed-guidelines
and remember to be kind during your reviews.

In addition to the discussions on GitHub we have weekly open developer calls
that you are invited to join (links below) on Thurdays at 1900 UTC <(their timezone if you know it)>.

If you accept, welcome (formally) to the team!

Tom (on behalf of the SC)
