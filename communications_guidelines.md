# Communication Guidelines
These guidelines are applicable when acting as a representitive of Matplotlib (for example at sprints or when giving official talks or tutorials) and in the following community venues managed by matplotlib:
* https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib
* https://discourse.matplotlib.org/
* https://gitter.im/matplotlib/ 
* https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotblog 
* https://twitter.com/matplotlib
* https://instagram.com/matplotart/

## Content Guidelines:
- stick to Matplotlib, 3rd party packages, and visualizations made with Matplotlib
- also acceptable topics: Python, Visualization, Numfocus libraries
- no gratuitous disparaging of other visualization libraries and tools; criticism is acceptable so long as it serves a constructive purpose
- verify sourcing of content (especially on instagram & blog)
    - Instagram/blog: ensure mpl has right to repost/share content 
    - make sure content is clearly cited
        - example: a tutorial using someone elseâ€™s example clearly cites the original source
- Limited self/corporate promotion is acceptable, but should be no more than about a quarter of the content of the blog/discourse post. 
- if you think content is borderline, ask before publishing it 
- keep responses polite, assume user statements are in good faith unless they violate the [Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/)
- acceptable image guide:
    - union of site guidelines favoring caution:
        - keep  it geared towards science/data visualization, and non-controversial images

## Recurrent Social Media Campaigns:
- new features during release times
- signal  boost third party packages
- GSOC work during GSOC recruiting and work times
- John Hunter Excellence in Plotting, submission and winners

## Social Media Following Guide:
- only follow organizations/projects - mostly numfocus projects 
    - especially 3rd party packages
    - should at least be visualization related
    - sponsors are also acceptable
- do not follow individual accounts for any reason (even maintainers/project leads/Guido!)
